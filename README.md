# Perceptron
Perceptron is a single layer neural network. 


### Motivation: 
A machine-based algorithm used for supervised learning of various binary sorting tasks is called Perceptron.


Perceptron also has an essential role as an Artificial Neuron or Neural link in detecting certain input data computations in business intelligence.


### Key points in perceptron:
The perceptron consists of 4 parts.

* Input values or One input layer
* Weights and Bias
* Net sum
* Activation Function
